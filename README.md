## Description
For this project, we needed to have create a weather website projecting a 5 day forcast. The website is able to display the current days weather information, and the 5 day forecast using weatherbit.io API. The deployment link for Github is not working. I have tried pushing it to main and it is still not working. Below I am going to link the the github deplpoyed website which is NOT functional for some reason. I am also attaching screenshots as well as a walkthrough video to show you how it is working on my localhost. If you have any questions my contact information is below!
